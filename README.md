### Private Settings/Api keys etc.

Define a api-keys.properties file and put the following settings in it
- translator.google.projectId [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=langfella-6d941) You also need to login to Google Cloud via google-cloud-sdk (link already includes the projectId, but kept the setting private anyway)
- translator.deepl.api-key [DeepL Account](https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys)
